#LogCat
A simple plugin to show messages in logcat. 
Can be useful when a custom logger is used in a Unity project that doesn't have the default Unity logger as a target, but you still want to use logcat when working with android builds.
Just add UnityLogCat plugin and a new log target as in the Unity example from this repo.
